<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">5.15 Copper Areas</font></p>
<p>Besides traces, <b>copper</b> <b>areas</b> can be used for connections on a
PCB. These are commonly used for power and ground planes, in which case they may
occupy an entire layer of the board. In FreePCB, all copper areas must be
assigned to a net.</p>
<p>Copper areas are drawn as closed polylines (or polygons), similar to the
board outline. They can be displayed as a simple outline,&nbsp; an outline with
internal hatching, or an outline with a little bit of hatching along its inner
edge. These hatch patterns are for visual reference only, as the actual copper
area on the PCB will be solid copper. FreePCB will automatically create
clearances around any pads or traces which pass through the copper area on the
same layer. However, these clearances will not be displayed, but will be created
in the Gerber files.</p>
<p>To create a new copper area, select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Copper
Area</u></font> from the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Add</u></font>
menu. The following dialog will appear.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/add_area.gif" width="239" height="288"></p>
<p>Select the net for the copper area from the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Net</u></font>
drop-down menu, or type the net name directly into the field. Select the layer
from the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Layer</u></font> list. Choose
the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Hatch pattern</u></font>. Then click <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>OK</u></font>
to start drawing the area. The cursor will change to cross-hairs, and the
<b>Routing</b> <b>Grid</b> will be in effect. Move to the desired position of
the starting corner, and left-click to place it. Now you will be dragging the
first side of the polyline. As with the board outline, you can change the style
of the side from straight to a clockwise or counterclockwise arc by using the
function-key menu. Continue left-clicking to place the rest of the corners, and
right click to close the polyline. The copper area will then fill with a
diagonal hatch pattern, to make it more visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of a small copper area on the inner 1 layer is shown below. This
area was assigned to the GND net, and it uses the full hatch pattern.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/small_area.gif" width="446" height="279"></p>
<p>Once created, a copper area can be edited by selecting corners or sides and
using the function-key menu. This is exactly the same as editing the board
outline, so you can just refer to <a href="user_guide_outline.htm">Section 5.10:
Board Outline</a> for instructions. You can change the hatch pattern by
selecting a side and right-clicking, then selecting <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Hatch
style</u></font> from the context menu.</p>
<p align="left">Connections between parts and copper areas can be made two ways:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li>
    <p align="left">Through-hole pins which pass through the copper area can
    connect using thermal reliefs. These will be placed automatically for pins
    on the same net as the copper area. They are indicated by an &quot;X&quot;
    drawn on the pin in the ratline color.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">SMT pads or through-hole pins which do not pass through the
    copper area can be connected using stub traces which terminate with vias. A
    thermal relief will be placed automatically on the via.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">To illustrate, 4 parts have been placed, overlying the copper
area in our previous example. Only the GND net has been made visible, which is
the net assigned to the copper area. Note that pins Y1.4, JP2.2, JP2.3, JP2.4,
JP2.6, JP2.8, JP2.10 have all been automatically connected to the copper area by
thermal reliefs.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/small_area_parts.gif" width="443" height="279"></p>
<p align="left">To connect R1.1 and C1.2, we will use stub traces. These have
been added below. Note that the vias on the ends of the stubs have been
connected with thermal reliefs. Now the entire GND net has been connected using
the copper area.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/small_area_stubs.gif" width="439" height="272"></p>
<p align="left">The hatch pattern in the copper area is only intended as a
visual aid, to show the extent of the area while allowing other features to show
through. When the Gerber files are generated, the area will be solid copper with
clearances for any non-connected pads and traces which pass through it.</p>
<p align="left">In the tutorial, you will use copper areas to create power and
ground planes which occupy entire layers of the PCB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="3" color="#0000FF">5.151 Copper Area Cutouts</font></p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to &quot;cut out&quot; a portion of a copper area.
This may be done to create an opening inside the copper area, or to modify its
outline. To create a cutout, select a side or corner of the area and press F6
(Add Cutout). Then draw the cutout just as you would draw a new area. The image
below shows our copper area with cutouts around Y1 and JP2.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/small_area_cutouts.gif" width="436" height="268"></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Actually, I cheated a bit to get the screen shot above. If you tried to add the cutouts directly to the area
as shown, you would get an error message indicating that cutouts are not
allowed in copper areas that use arcs. This is due to a limitation in the
polygon clipping library that FreePCB uses, which only allows straight lines in
polygons. Therefore, I converted the arcs to
straight lines, added the cutouts, and then converted the straight lines back to
arcs. Feel free to use this trick in your own designs.</p>
