Overview of the PCB Design Process</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">This is a brief overview of the PCB design
process, with explanations of some terms which have special importance to
FreePCB. These are shown in <b>bold</b> <b>type</b> as they are introduced.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.1 Schematic Diagram</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Most PCB designs start out as a <b>Schematic
Diagram,</b> which shows the <b>Devices</b> used in the design and the<b>
Connections</b>
between them. Each device in the schematic has a<b> Reference Designator </b>such as &quot;U1&quot;
or&nbsp; &quot;R3&quot;. The connection points on the devices are called <b>Pins</b>,
even though they may actually be non-pin terminals such as tabs, wire leads, screw
terminals, etc. In general, the PCB should contain devices and connections
exactly as shown on the schematic. If the designer makes changes to the PCB
layout which create discrepancies between the PCB and the schematic, the
schematic should be <b>Back-Annotated</b> to reflect the changes.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.2 Specifying Parts, Packages
and Pin Names</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The first step in designing a PCB from a
schematic is to select a
physical <b>Part</b> for each device in the schematic. At the very least,
the part specification should include the <b>Package</b> and <b>Pinout</b> for the
part. Once parts and packages have been chosen, it may be necessary to go back to the
schematic and assign <b>Pin Names</b>. A name must be assigned to every pin
in the design, even on parts which have interchangeable pins, such as resistors.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"><b>
Pin names</b> are usually numbers, but may also contain letters. If letters are
used, FreePCB requires that they precede any numbers. For example,
&quot;12&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;SOURCE&quot; and &quot;A23&quot; are legal
pin names, while &quot;1A&quot; and &quot;A1A&quot; are not. Characters other
than letters and numbers are not allowed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">The <b>Package</b> <b>Identifier</b>   is a
string such as &quot;DIP16&quot;&nbsp; which identifies
the package to FreePCB, and determines which <b>Footprint</b>  to use for the
part. The footprint includes the copper <b>Pads</b> to which pins will be
soldered, as well as graphical elements such as a <b>Part</b> <b>Outline</b> and
a <b>Text String</b> for the reference designator.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.3 The Partlist</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"> The <b>Partlist</b> is a list of all of
the parts in a design, with their reference designators and package identifiers. A
sample partlist is
shown below:</font></p>
<table border="1" width="480">
  <tr>
    <td><b>Reference Designator</b></td>
    <td><b>Package Identifier</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>U1</td>
    <td>DIP14</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>R1</td>
    <td>RES_1/4W_AXIAL</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>C1</td>
    <td>CHIP_0805</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.4 The Netlist</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3"> A <b>Net</b> is a set of pins which
are connected together by lines on the schematic. Each pin in the net is identified by a
text string consisting of the reference designator of the part containing the pin, the character
&quot;.&quot;, and the pin name. For example, pin 8 on part U5 would be
&quot;U5.8&quot;. Each net must have a unique name, which may be meaningful and
descriptive, or merely distinctive. The set of pins in a net is called the <b>Pin
List</b>.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3">A <b>Netlist</b> is a list of all of the nets in
the design, with their pin lists. A sample netlist is shown below:</font></p>
<table border="1" width="500" height="98">
  <tr>
    <td height="19"><b>Net Name</b></td>
    <td height="19"><b>Pin List</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="19">VCC</td>
    <td height="19">U1.14,&nbsp;&nbsp; R1.1,&nbsp;&nbsp; C1.1,&nbsp;&nbsp; Q1.C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="19">GND</td>
    <td height="19">U1.7,&nbsp;&nbsp; C1.2,&nbsp;&nbsp; Q1.E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="17">$$1234</td>
    <td height="17">U1.1,&nbsp;&nbsp; R1.2,&nbsp;&nbsp; U1.2,&nbsp;&nbsp; Q1.B</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.5 Making Netlist
Files</font></p>
<p align="left">If the schematic was created with a schematic editor, the
partlist and netlist can be automatically written to a <b>Netlist
File</b>. Most editors will produce netlist files in a variety of formats. You
should choose a format which is recognized by FreePCB, such as
&quot;PADS-PCB&quot;. A netlist file in this format is shown below. The
listing is pretty much self-explanatory.</p>
<code>*PADS-PCB*<br>
*PARTS*<br>
U1 DIP14<br>
R1 RES_1/4W_AXIAL<br>
C1 C0805<br><br>
*NETS*<br>
*SIGNAL* GND<br>
U1.7 C1.2<br><br>
*SIGNAL* $1234<br>
U1.1 R1.2 U1.2<br>


</code>
<p>If you are
working from a printed or hand-drawn schematic, you will have the make the netlist
file manually. This is actually pretty easy, although it can get tedious on a large
design. I usually make a photocopy of the schematic that I can draw on. Then I start
making the netlist file using a text editor. For each part, I
highlight the reference designator on the schematic with a yellow felt-tip pen as I add
it the partlist. Then I assign net names and pin names (if they are not already on the
schematic) and make the netlist. For each net, I use the yellow highlighter and draw over
each connection as I add it to the pin list. When I
am finished, every part and every connection on the schematic should be
highlighted in yellow. Then, I print out the netlist file and check it line-by-line. As I go, I again highlight the parts and
connections in the schematic, this time with a red pen, making sure that
every part and every connection is included. I have made quite large netlist
files this way without errors.</p>
<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.6 Importing
Netlist Files into FreePCB</font></p>
<p align="left">Once your netlist file is complete, you can
import it into FreePCB to start your design. FreePCB will try to find a
footprint to match the package identifier for each part. If this is
unsuccessful, you can assign footprints manually, or go back and edit the
netlist. All of the footprints will be placed near the lower left corner of
the PCB design area. FreePCB then loads the nets from the netlist, breaking each net into a set of connections between
the pins in the net. These will appear as &quot;rubber-band&quot; lines between
the pins, called <b>Ratlines</b>. As you move the parts around, the ratlines
will move with them.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.7 Adding Parts and Nets
&quot;On-the-Fly&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"> Alternatively, you can create a
design in FreePCB without a netlist file by using the &quot;<b>on-the-fly</b>&quot;
editing technique. Starting with an empty design, add each part, net&nbsp;and
connection using the <font face="Fixedsys" color="#008000"><u>Modify</u></font>
and <font face="Fixedsys" color="#008000"><u>Add</u></font> menus. You
will be prompted for the reference designators and net names as necessary. This works
reasonably well for small designs, but I prefer to create a netlist file as described
above.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.8 Placing Parts</font></p>
<p align="left">The next step is to <b>Place</b> the parts on the PCB by moving
and rotating them as necessary. After you move a part, FreePCB will
automatically reassign the ratlines of every net connected to the part to minimize their total length. Alignment
of parts is made easier by using a <b>Snap Grid</b>.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.9 Routing Traces</font></p>
<p align="left">Once the parts are placed, <b>Routing</b> begins. This is
usually the most time-consuming part of the PCB design process. Each connection
must be converted to a copper <b>Trace</b>, consisting of multiple straight-line
<b>Segments</b>. The points where trace segments join are called <b>Vertices</b>.
The segments may all be on the same copper <b>Layer</b>, or may
be on different layers, in which case they will be connected by <b>Vias</b>. At
this point, FreePCB only supports full-thickness vias, not blind or hidden vias.
<b>Copper</b>
<b>Areas</b> can also be created, which are useful for ground and power planes. <b>Stub
Traces</b> can be used to connect SMT pads to the copper areas. The snap grid is very useful for aligning traces. You can also set a <b>Snap Angle</b>,
which forces trace segments to be oriented at multiples of the snap angle
(usually 45 degrees).&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.10 Adding Text</font></p>
<p align="left"> <b>Text</b>  <b>Strings</b> may be added for labels, revision
numbers, copyright notices, etc. These will usually be placed on the
silk-screen layers.</p>

<p align="left"><font color="#0000FF" size="4">4.11 Plot and Drill Files</font></p>
<p align="left">Plots of each layer can be exported as <b>Gerber</b> <b>Files, </b>which are used to make <b>Photoplots</b>
for PCB fabrication. FreePCB can also produce <b>Drill Files</b>, which specify
all of the holes to be drilled in the board. You can use a free <b>Gerber Viewer</b>
such as ViewMate by PentaLogix to check your files and make <b>Check Plots</b>
on a Windows printer. Then send
your Gerber and drill files to a <b> PCB Fabrication Company</b> (along with some
<b>Money</b>), and they will send back finished boards, usually in a couple of
days. How <b>Cool</b> is that!</p>
