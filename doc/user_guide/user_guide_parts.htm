<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">5.11 Parts</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.111 The Anatomy of a Part</b></font></p>
<p>Every PCB will include one or more <b>parts</b>.&nbsp; Each part contains the
following elements:</p>

<ul type="square">
  <li><b>reference designator</b>, such as &quot;U1&quot;&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is usually assigned in a <b>schematic diagram</b>,
    and must be unique.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>package</b> <b>identifier</b>, such as &quot;DIP14&quot;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Parts come in various
physical packages, and the PCB designer must know which package will be
used for each part, because this will determine the <b>footprint</b> for the
part in the PCB layout.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>pins</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; The electrical terminals of a part are called pins, even when they are
non-pin terminals such as wire leads, tabs, etc. Pins are identified by a name
    (which is usually a number) which is appended to the reference designator, such as &quot;U1.4&quot; for
    pin four on part U1. The way pins are named will depend on the
    package. All pins must be named, even interchangeable pins such as the
    leads on a resistor.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>mounting holes&nbsp;</b> -&nbsp; Mounting holes may be used to attach
    parts to a PCB. A fastener such as a machine screw may be passed through the
    hole, or the part may have built-in fasteners such as press-fit posts or
    solder tabs. Mounting holes may be insulated, or may have pads and be
    plated-through. It is not unusual to use a plated-through mounting hole to
    make an electrical connection to a part, such as a ground connection to a
    connector shield. Therefore, FreePCB treats all mounting holes as pins. The
    pin names assigned to mounting holes are usually numbers that are higher than the numbers used for
    conventional pins. For example, a 9-pin D-SUB connector with 2 mounting
    holes would have pin numbers 10 and 11 assigned to the mounting holes.</li>
  <li><b>footprint</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is the pattern of copper pads and other
    elements which will become part of the PCB layout.</li>
</ul>
<p> Actually, when we use the term &quot;part&quot; during
PCB layout, we are usually referring to the part's footprint, because this is what we
are working with in the layout. The actual part is the
electronic component which will be soldered to the footprint when the PCB is
assembled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footprints have the following elements:</p>
<ul type="square">
  <li><b>pads</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; These are the copper elements to which pins will
    be soldered. There are two types:&nbsp;
    <ul type="square">
      <li> <b>Through-hole pads</b> have a hole drilled through them
so that the pin can be passed through the hole before soldering. For a
through-hole pad on a multilayer board, there is usually a pad on each copper layer, connected
together by plating the hole with copper. This arrangement is called a <b>padstack</b>.
        Through-hole pads are usually round or square. A common arrangement is to use
a square pad for pin 1 and round pads for the rest of the pins.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
<b>Surface-mount pads</b> do not have a hole, and are only on one layer.
Nevertheless, they are still represented by a padstack, although it is a pretty
simple one with only one pad. Surface-mount
pads are almost always rectangular.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>part outline</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is a graphical representation of the
part on the silk-screen layer.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>reference text</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is a text string for the
    reference designator on the silk-screen layer.</li>
  <li><b>other text</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; Text strings such as pin numbers, etc. can
    be added to the silk-screen layer.</li>
  <li><b>selection rectangle</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is invisible until the part
    is selected, then it is shown in the selection layer color (usually white).
    It determines the boundary of the part for selection purposes.</li>
  <li><b>origin</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; This is an invisible point which serves as
    the origin for the internal coordinate system of the footprint. When a footprint is created, the
    position of each element will be specified relative to the origin. When
    a footprint is dragged during editing, it will be &quot;attached&quot; to
    the cursor at the origin. When the position of a part is reported in the
    status bar or in dialogs, it is actually the position of the origin which is
    reported. The center of pin 1 is often used as the origin.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some typical footprints are shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/several_parts.gif" width="817" height="600"></p>

<p align="left">In the screenshot above, U1 is an IC in a 20-pin DIP package,
with though-hole pins. It has been placed on the top (or component) side of the
board, so the silk-screen elements of the footprint are on the top silk-screen layer. It has been selected for editing,
so its selection rectangle is visible. Since the top copper layer is the active
routing layer, its&nbsp; top pads are shown in the color for the top copper
layer.</p>

<p align="left">U2 is an IC in a 20-pin surface-mount PLCC package, also on the
top side of the board. Its pads are drawn in the color for the top copper layer.
C10 is a surface-mount capacitor in a chip package. R12
is a surface-mount resistor in a different chip package, on the bottom (or
solder) side of the PCB. Its pads are drawn in the color of the bottom copper
layer and its silk-screen elements are drawn on the bottom silk-screen layer.
Also, its reference text is drawn as a mirror-image, so that it will
be readable from the bottom of the board.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.112 The Partlist</b></font></p>
<p>In FreePCB, all of the parts in a project are contained in a data structure
called the <b>partlist</b>, which is empty when the project is first created.
Normally, parts are added to the partlist by importing a <b>netlist file</b>
from a schematic editor. This will be covered in <a href="user_guide_netlist.htm">Section
5.14: Importing Netlist Files</a>. You can view or edit the partlist by
selecting <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Parts...</font></u> from the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Project</font></u>
menu, which pops up the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">View/Edit Part
List</font></u> dialog, as shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/partlist2.gif" width="743" height="535"></p>

<p>Each part in the project is listed by reference designator, package and
footprint. Individual parts can be selected from the list by clicking on them,
or multiple parts can be selected by clicking with the Ctrl key held down. The
partlist can be modified using the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Add
New Part</font></u>, <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Edit Selection</font></u>,
and <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Delete Selection(s)</font></u>
buttons. These will be described in the following sections.</p>

<b><u>Important Note</u></b>: You should be careful when modifying the partlist, for two reasons.&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>If
you are working from a schematic, editing the partlist can introduce
discrepancies between the schematic and the PCB. This should not be a problem if
you are just assigning footprints, but could be very confusing if you add or
delete parts or change reference designators. If you do make any changes like
        these, you should <b>back-annotate</b> the schematic to reflect them.</li>
      <li>Once you click <u><font face="System" color="#008000">OK</font></u>
        in the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">View/Edit Part List</font></u>
        dialog, the changes that you made CANNOT be undone with the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Undo</font></u>
        function from the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Edit</font></u>
        menu. Therefore, you should probably save a copy of your project
        beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.113 Editing Parts</b></font></p>
<p>Parts can be added, deleted or modified from either the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">View/Edit
Part List</font></u> dialog (shown above) or the layout window, using the
methods described below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>New parts can be added to the partlist using either the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Part</font></u>
    selection from the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Add</font></u>
    menu, or the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Add New Part</font></u>
    button in the&nbsp;<u><font face="System" color="#008000">View/Edit Part
    List</font></u> dialog. Either method pops up the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Add/Edit Part</font></u>
    dialog, shown below
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/add_edit_part_9.gif" width="545" height="565"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>A new part is created by entering a reference designator into the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Reference</font></u>
        field, and selecting a footprint from the large tree control which
        occupies the left side&nbsp; of the dialog. This control contains a list of all of the
        files in the selected library folder. You can change library folders
        using the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Browse...</font></u>
        button. There is
        also an entry for &quot;local cache&quot;, which contains all of the
        footprints which are already loaded into the project. You can expand a
        library by clicking on the &quot;+&quot; next to it. In the example above, the library <font face="Arial Black" size="2">C:
        \FreePCB\lib\sm_plcc.fpl </font>has been expanded. The footprint &quot;LCC-24&quot; has been
        selected and is shown in the preview pane. Its name has been
        automatically entered into the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Footprint</font></u>
        field of the dialog. Alternatively, you can just type the footprint name
        directly into this field.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>If you leave the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Position</font></u>
        radio button set to <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Drag to
        position</font></u>, you will be dragging the new part when you click <u><font face="System" color="#008000">OK</font></u>.
        If you want to position the part explicitly, you can use the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Set
        position</font></u> radio button and the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">X</font></u>,
        <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Y</font></u>, <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Angle</font></u>
        and <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Side</font></u> fields in the
        <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Position</font></u> box. Then
        when you click <u><font face="System" color="#008000">OK</font></u>, the
        new part will be placed at the position that you set. If you select <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Off-board</font></u>,
        the part will be placed to the left of the origin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Parts can be deleted or edited from the layout window by selecting them,
    and using
    the function-key or context menus. With a part selected, the following menu items are available:
    <ul>
      <li><b>F1 (&quot;Edit Part&quot;)</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; this pops up the same <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Add/Edit
    Part</font></u> dialog which was shown previously, except that the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Reference</font></u>
        and <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Footprint</font></u> fields
        are filled-in. You can use this dialog to change the footprint or
        position of the part.</li>
      <li><b>F3 (&quot;Glue Part&quot;)</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; this &quot;glues&quot; a
    part in place so that it cannot be accidentally moved without
    &quot;ungluing&quot; it. For a part which is already glued, this command
    changes to &quot;Unglue Part&quot;.</li>
      <li><b>F4 (&quot;Move Part&quot;)&nbsp;</b> -&nbsp; this is the most commonly
    used command. It initiates dragging the part with the cursor. Then left-click to &quot;drop&quot; the part at a new
    position. While dragging, the following function-keys are active:
    <ul type="square">
      <li><b>F2 (&quot;Change Side&quot;)</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; flip the part from
        the top side to the bottom or vice-versa</li>
      <li><b>F3 (&quot;Rotate Part&quot;)</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; perform a 90 degree
        clockwise rotation of the part</li>
    </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>F7 (&quot;Delete part&quot;)</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; this deletes the part
    from the partlist. You will be asked if you also wish to delete all
    references to the part from the netlist. Normally you would answer
    &quot;Yes&quot; unless you think that you might add the part back at a later
    time.</li>
      <li><b>F8 (&quot;Recalc. Ratlines&quot;)</b>&nbsp; -&nbsp; this recalculates
    the ratlines for all nets connected to the part, to minimize their total
    length. By default, this command is executed automatically each time a part
    is moved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Parts may also be deleted or edited from <u><font face="System" color="#008000">View/Edit
    Part List</font></u>  dialog, as follows.&nbsp;
    <ul>
      <li>You can delete one or more parts from the list by clicking on them
        (holding the Ctrl key down for multiple selections), and then click the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Delete
        Selection(s)</font></u> button.&nbsp;References to the part(s) will NOT
        be removed from the netlist.</li>
      <li>A single part can be edited using the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Edit
        Selection</u></font>  button, which pops up the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Add/Edit
        Part</u></font> dialog, which was shown earlier. The main reason for using the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">View/Edit
        Part List</font></u> dialog to edit parts, instead of just selecting
        them in the layout window and using the function key menu, is to assign
        footprints to parts which don't already have them. A part without a
        footprint can't be displayed, so it can't be selected in the layout
        window. This situation often arises when importing netlist files, as discussed in
        <a href="user_guide_netlist.htm">Section 5.14:
        Importing Netlist Files</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.114 Moving or Resizing the Reference
Designator</b></font></p>
The reference designator for a part may be moved by selecting it and pressing F4
(&quot;Move Ref Tex&quot;). Then you can drag it to a new position. While
dragging, it can be rotated 90 degrees clockwise by pressing F3 (&quot;Rotate
Ref Text&quot;).&nbsp;
<p>You can change the size of the text string by selecting it and pressing F1
(&quot;Set Size&quot;). This pops up the dialog shown below. You can change the
character height and the stroke width. If you select <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Use
default for height</font></u>, the stroke width will automatically be set to
1/10 of the height.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/ref_text_props.gif" width="275" height="257"></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.115 Making the Reference
Designator Invisible</b></font></p>
<p>If you set the character height of the reference text to &quot;0&quot;, the
reference designator will become invisible. To make it visible again, select the part and
right-click, then select <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Set Ref. Text Size</font></u> from the context menu
that pops up. Then set the character height to a non-zero value.</p>
