<p align="left">Most Windows drawing programs make heavy use of
&quot;click-dragging&quot; with the mouse for editing. This means holding the
left mouse button down while moving the mouse. For example, the user may move an
item by click-dragging it to a new position. An item may be resized by clicking
on it, which brings up a selection box with &quot;handles&quot;, which may then
be click-dragged to stretch or shrink the item. The endpoints of lines may be
click-dragged to new positions, etc., etc.</p>
<p align="left">However, click-dragging doesn't work very well for routing
traces, which is the most time-consuming part of PCB layout. Traces are
basically polylines, consisting of multiple connected line segments. Placing
each segment requires a separate mouse-click, which implies that the segments
must be dragged without holding the mouse button down.</p>
<p align="left">Also, while routing traces or placing parts, it is useful to be
able to pan and zoom, which I like to do with the scroll wheel on the mouse. It
is very difficult to use the scroll wheel while simultaneously holding down a
mouse button.</p>
<p align="left">Therefore, FreePCB uses a slightly different approach.
Generally, an item will be selected by clicking on it. This will highlight the
item, to indicate that it has been selected, and a description of the item will
appear on the status bar. An editing operation can then be performed by pressing
a function-key on the keyboard. The operations assigned to each function-key are
always listed across the bottom of the FreePCB window. This list is
context-sensitive, and will change depending on which item has been selected.
For example, the menu when a part is selected is shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/function_keys.gif" width="636" height="36"></p>

<p align="left">If the operation requires dragging, this will commence as soon
as the function-key is pressed. The operation is usually completed by
left-clicking the mouse, or it can be cancelled by right-clicking. While
dragging, the function-keys remain active, so that additional operations can be
performed. For example, while dragging a part, pressing F3 will rotate it, while
pressing F2 will flip it to the opposite side of the board.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This style of user interface requires that you keep your left
hand on the keyboard and your right hand on the mouse while editing (assuming
that you are right-handed). In the days of DOS, many CAD programs used this
style, and some still do. If you have any doubt about the speed and efficiency
of the &quot;left hand on keyboard, right hand on mouse&quot; approach, just
spend a few minutes watching someone play one of the popular first-person
shooter games for the PC, such as Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, Half-life,
Tribes, etc. They ALL use this style of user interface. And routing a PCB is
usually easier than circle-strafing a horde of rampaging Nazi mutants while
dodging flying chainsaws in zero-G!</p>

<p align="left">The assignment of editing operations to the function keys is not
completely random, as it might first appear. Since the fingers of the left hand
will normally rest on keys F1-F4, these are used for the primary editing
operations. F4 (under the index finger) is used for the most common operation on
the selected item (such as moving a part), while F2-F3 are used for less common
operations. F1 is often used to pop up some sort of dialog to edit the
properties of the selected item. The keys F5-F7 are usually used for deleting or
unrouting, since they require moving the hand and are less likely to be hit
accidentally. F8 is reserved for recalculating ratlines. This arrangement is
obviously optimized for users who are right-handed (like me). I expect to add a
&quot;left-handed&quot; option in the future.</p>

<p align="left">If you prefer not to use the function keys, right-clicking the
mouse will pop up a more traditional Windows menu, as shown below. This is
called the &quot;context menu&quot;.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/part_context_menu.gif" width="125" height="116"></p>

<p align="left">The context menu is not available while you are dragging an item
with the mouse, so function keys must be used to perform operations while
dragging.</p>
