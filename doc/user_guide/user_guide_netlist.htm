<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.141 Netlist Files</b></font></p>
<p>After a new project is created, parts and nets can added to it by importing a
<b>netlist file</b>. This file is usually produced by a schematic editor, but
you can create it by hand if necessary.</p>

<p>A sample netlist file is shown below. This file will be used
later in the tutorial (see <a href="user_guide_tutorial_schematic.htm">Section
7. Tutorial</a>). It was produced by a schematic editor called Orcad Capture, in
PADS-PCB format. This is a common format, and most schematic editors support it.
Most importantly, FreePCB can read it.&nbsp;</p>

</code>
<p> The listing is fairly self-explanatory. In the <code>*PART*</code> section of the file,
there is a line for each part, containing a reference designator (such as &quot;<code>U1</code>&quot;) and a package
identifier (such as &quot;<code>28DIP300</code>&quot;). In the <code>*NET*</code>
section, each net starts with the <code>*SIGNAL*</code> keyword, followed by the
name of the net. All of the pins in the net are then listed on subsequent lines.</p>

<p>In order for FreePCB to assign
footprints, the package identifier for each part must match a footprint in one
of the FreePCB libraries. Since there is no universal standard for package
identifiers, you will probably have to assign these explicitly.</p>

<p>Basically, there are 3 ways to do this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In the schematic editor, assign the package identifier as an attribute for
    each part, using package identifiers that match FreePCB footprints. Then
    export the netlist, and import it into FreePCB.</li>
  <li>Export the netlist, edit it using a text editor, and then import it into
    FreePCB.</li>
  <li>Export the netlist, import it into FreePCB, and then fix any incorrect or
    missing footprints within FreePCB.</li>
</ol>
<p>Option 1 is definitely the way to go if you think that you might make changes
to your schematic after you start routing the board, and want to import those
changes into FreePCB.</p>
<p><b>Important note:</b>  For FreePCB to find the footprints referenced
in the netlist file, the libraries containing those footprints must be in the
default library folder for the project (usually ..\lib). If you are using
footprints from libraries in other folders, such as ..\lib_contrib or ..\lib_extra,
you should move those libraries into ..\lib before importing the netlist file.
If you forget to do this, you can always assign the footprints later, using the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Project
&gt; Parts...</font></u>
dialog.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.142 Importing Netlist Files into a Project</b></font></p>
<p>To import a netlist file, select <u><font face="System" color="#008000">File &gt;
Imp</font></u><font face="System" color="#008000"><u>ort
netlist...</u></font>. This will
pop up the following dialog.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/import.gif" width="426" height="453"></p>
<p>Select the netlist file by navigating to the correct folder (if necessary)
and clicking on the file name. I usually move or copy the netlist file into the
project folder before importing it, but this is not necessary. Using the radio
buttons, you can choose to import only the parts from the file, only the nets,
or both. You can also select the file format (although currently only the
PADS-PCB format is supported). Then click <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>OK</u></font>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are importing the netlist file into an empty project, without existing
parts or nets, the file will load immediately. Otherwise, the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Import Options</u></font>
 dialog will appear, as shown below. This dialog determines how FreePCB handles conflicts that
may arise when importing a netlist file into a project that already contains
parts and/or nets. This situation usually arises when you are using a schematic
editor. For example, suppose that after importing your initial netlist and
laying out some or all of the PCB, you make some changes in the schematic and
wish to import those changes. With the the default settings shown
below, any parts, footprints or nets in the project that don't match the new
netlist file will be changed or deleted, and the project will exactly match the
netlist file. Most of the time, this will be what you want.</p>
<p>However, suppose that you have added some parts to the project (such as
mounting holes, for example) that aren't in your netlist file, and you have
connected them to a net. Then you might want to select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>For
parts in project but not in netlist file: Keep parts and connections to nets</u></font>
so that you won't lose these parts and connections. Or, if you changed some of
the footprints after importing the netlist, you might want to select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>For
parts with different footprints in project and netlist file: Keep footprints</u></font>
so that you don't revert back to the old footprints after the import. If you
have added nets and wish to keep them, you might select <u><font face="System" color="#008000">For
nets in project that are not in netlist file: Keep nets</font></u>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should use these options carefully as they may cause unexpected results.
For example, if you inadvertently change a net name in the schematic editor and
then import the netlist with the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Keep
nets</font></u> option selected, you will wind up with 2 nets with different
names, with all of the pins in the new net except for any pins that were in the
old net but not in the new one. Also, you will lose all of the routing on the
new net (see note below). Or if you changed the reference designator of a part in the
schematic editor and you select one of the <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Keep
parts</font></u> options, you will wind up with a duplicate part.</p>
<p><b>Important note: </b>When importing a netlist file into a project that is already routed, FreePCB
tries to preserve as much of the routing as possible <b>as long as the net names
haven't changed</b>. If you change the name of a net in your netlist file,
you will lose all of the routing on this net, <b>UNLESS</b> you also change the
name of the net in FreePCB before importing the netlist file.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/import_options.gif"></p>
<p>Once you have selected the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Import
Options</u></font>, click <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>OK</u></font>.
The netlist file will load and all of the new parts will be placed in the layout window to the
left of the origin. To see them, you can select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>All
Parts</u></font> from the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>View</u></font>
 menu (or press the &quot;Home&quot; key), which will adjust the layout window to make all of the parts visible, as
shown below.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/pcb_parts.gif" width="817" height="592"></p>
<p>If FreePCB is unable to match any of the package identifiers with footprints
from its libraries, the following message will appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/import_warning.gif" width="293" height="119"></p>
&nbsp;In this case, you can check the partlist by selecting <span>Parts...</span>
from the <span>Project</span> menu. This will pop up the <span>View/Edit Part
List</span> dialog, as shown below.&nbsp;
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/partlist1.gif" width="561" height="535"></p>

<p>Note that the footprint for U2 is shown as &quot;??????&quot;, indicating
that FreePCB was unable to find a footprint with the identifier
&quot;dip14&quot;. A footprint can be assigned to this part by selecting it and
clicking the <span>Edit Selection</span> button, which pops up the <span>Add/Edit
Part</span> dialog, shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/add_edit_part_2.gif" width="545" height="565"></p>

<p>You can assign a footprint to U2 by expanding the library files in the dialog
until you find the footprint that you want, and then clicking on it to copy it
into the <span>Footprint</span> field of the dialog, as shown below. If you know the name of the
footprint, you can just enter it directly.&nbsp;

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/add_edit_part_7.gif" width="545" height="565">
<p> U2 should now have a
footprint in the layout window, placed at whatever position you set in the
dialog (X = 0, Y = 0 in the example above).
<p> &nbsp;<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.143 Exporting Netlist Files</b></font></p>

<p> You can export a netlist file from a project using the <span>File &gt; Export
netlist...</span> menu selection. In the resulting file, the package for each
part will be set to the name of the actual footprint that was used in the
project.
