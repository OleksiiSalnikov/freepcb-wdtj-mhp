<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.131 Nets</b></font></p>
<p>A <b>net</b> is a set of pins which will be connected together on the PCB.
Each net must have a unique name. These names may be descriptive (such as
&quot;GND&quot; or &quot;video_in&quot;) or merely distinctive (such as
&quot;N06744&quot;). In FreePCB, net names are limited to 40 characters in
length, and may contain special characters. Each <b>pin</b>
in a net is identified by a string consisting of the <b>reference designator</b>
of the part containing the pin, the character &quot;<b>.</b>&quot;, and the <b>pin
name</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Nets are usually read from a <b>netlist
file</b>, which also includes a list of <b>parts</b> in the design (see <a href="user_guide_netlist.htm">Section
5.14: Importing Netlist Files</a>). Two examples of nets are shown below.</p>
<p>Name:&nbsp; N00834<br>
Pins:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U2.4&nbsp; JP1.9</p>
<p><br>
Name:&nbsp; GND<br>
Pins:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U2.7&nbsp; C2.2&nbsp; U3.3&nbsp; C1.2&nbsp; U1.19&nbsp;

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.132 The Netlist</b></font></p>

<p>In FreePCB, all of the information about nets is stored in a data structure
called the <b>netlist</b>. It can be viewed and modified by selecting <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Nets</u></font>
from the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Project</u></font> menu. This pops up the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>View/Edit Netlist</u></font>
 dialog.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/netlist2.gif" width="528" height="504"></p>

<p>This dialog contains a list of all of the nets in the project.
The name, number of pins and the default trace width, via width and via hole
diameter are shown for each net.&nbsp;</p>

<p> The checkbox next to each name determines the <b>visibility</b>
of the net. If the visibility box is unchecked, then ratlines for that net will
NOT be displayed in the layout window. This is useful when you are working with
a particular net and do not wish to be distracted with other ratlines.
The <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Make all visible/invisible</u></font>
button checks or unchecks all of the boxes.</p>

<p>In the example above, the trace and via widths are set to zero
for most of the nets. This indicates that the project defaults are to be used.
The widths for the VCC and GND nets have been set to non-zero values which will
be used for traces in those nets. Widths can be changed by
selecting one or more nets, and clicking on the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Change
widths</u></font> button. This pops up the following dialog, which allows
setting the new widths.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/netlist_width.gif" width="306" height="183"></p>

<p>You can perform more extensive editing of a single net by selecting it and
clicking the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Edit selection</u></font>
button, which pops up:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/edit_net_vcc.gif" width="300" height="418"></p>

<p align="left">From here you can change the name, visibility and widths of a
net, and add or delete pins.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.133 Connections and Ratlines</b></font></p>
<p align="left">Like most PCB editors, FreePCB assumes that nets will be routed
as a series of connections, where each connection is between 2 pins. For any net
containing more than 2 pins, there will be multiple possible sets of
connections. For example, a net consisting of pins U1.1, U2.2 and U3.3 could be
routed as:
<ul>
  <li>(U1.1 to U2.2) and (U2.2 to U3.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>OR</b>
  <li>(U1.1 to U3.3) and (U2.2 to U3.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>OR</b>
  <li>(U1.1 to U3.3) and (U1.1 to U2.2)</li>
</ul>
For each net, FreePCB automatically generates a set of connections which
attempts to minimize the total distance between the connected pins. These
connections are shown as <b>ratlines</b> between pins. An example of two nets
connecting three parts is shown below.
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/ratlines.gif" width="343" height="271"></p>
After most editing operations, FreePCB recalculates the ratlines for each
affected net. This is most obvious when
you are moving parts or adding copper areas. For example, moving D1 to the right
causes the connections to change, as shown below.
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/ratlines2.gif" width="339" height="270"></p>
<p align="left">If you are designing a PCB &quot;on-the-fly&quot; without a
netlist, you can use stub traces instead of adding connections and routing them.
See the note in <a href="#4.137 Stub Traces">Section 5.137: Stub Traces</a> for
details.</p>
<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.134 Modifying Ratlines</b></font></p>
Most of the time, you will use the ratlines which FreePCB calculates. However, there may be situations when you would like more control
over the ratlines. FreePCB provides several editing options for ratlines:&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>A ratline can be <b>locked</b> by selecting it and pressing F3 (&quot;Lock
    Connect&quot;). The appearance of the ratline doesn't change, but
    &quot;(L)&quot; will appear in its description on the status bar to indicate
    that it is locked. A locked connection will NOT be removed when FreePCB
    recalculates ratlines. A locked connection may be unlocked by selecting it
    and pressing F3 (&quot;Unlock Connect&quot;).
  <li>A connection may be added to a net by selecting the pad for the starting
    pin of the connection, and pressing F4 (&quot;Connect Pin&quot;). You can
    then draw a ratline to another pin on the same net. Normally, you should
    lock the ratline after adding it, otherwise it will probably be removed by
    FreePCB the next time the ratlines are recalculated. You can also make a connection to
    an unassigned pin, in which case the new pin will be added to the net.
  <li>A ratline may be removed from a net by selecting it and pressing F7
    (&quot;Delete Connect&quot;). If the ratline is locked, you will be prompted
    to unlock it. If you remove a ratline and don't replace it by adding and
    locking another one, it will probably reappear the next time the ratlines
    are recalculated.
  <li>The ratlines for each net are usually recalculated after each editing
    operation which affects the net. The exceptions are those operations which
    directly modify the ratlines, such as the ones described above. To force
    FreePCB to regenerate ratlines, press F8 (&quot;Recalc. Ratlines&quot;). The
    scope of this command depends on which item was selected when you pressed
    F8:
    <ul>
      <li>If nothing was selected, ratlines will be regenerated for every net in
        the project.
      <li>If a part was selected, ratlines will be regenerated for each net
        attached to the part.
      <li>If a pin, ratline, or trace was selected, ratlines will be regenerated
        for the net attached to that pin, ratline or trace.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.135 Routing</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><b>Routing</b> is the process of converting ratlines to copper <b>traces</b>.
Traces consist of one or more straight-line <b>segments</b>, connected together with <b>vertices</b>
 at their connection points. If two adjacent segments are on different layers, a <b>via</b>
will be placed at the vertex between them.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">To begin routing, select a ratline by clicking on it. It will
change to the selection color to indicate that it has been selected. Then press
F4 (&quot;Route Segment&quot;). You will find yourself dragging a trace segment
from the pin of the connection that was closest to the cursor when you pressed
F4. The image below shows a segment being routed from pin 1 of JP6.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Note that the segment is on the top copper layer because that
was the active layer when we started routing. You can change the active layer by
pressing one of the numeric keys &quot;1&quot; through &quot;8&quot;, which
represent the available layers in top-to-bottom order. For example, for a
four-layer board, &quot;1&quot; would select the <b>top copper</b> layer,
&quot;2&quot; would select the <b>inner 1</b> layer, &quot;3&quot; would select
the <b>inner 2</b> layer, and &quot;4&quot; would select the <b>bottom copper</b>
layer. If you change layers while routing a segment, it will immediately switch
to the new active layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="graphics/route6.gif" width="339" height="268"></p>
<p>Left-clicking will place a vertex at the cursor position, end the first
segment at the vertex, and initiate routing a second segment from the vertex, as
shown in the next image. We have also switched layers by pressing the numeric
key &quot;4&quot;, so that the new segment is being drawn on the bottom copper
layer.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/route9.gif" width="337" height="264"></p>
<p>Left-click again to place the next vertex and start routing the next segment.
In this way you can draw a trace consisting of multiple connected segments on
multiple layers. The image below shows our trace nearing completion with several
segments on different layers, with 2 vias.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/route7.gif" width="336" height="267"></p>
<p align="left">To finish the trace, press F4 (&quot;Complete Segment&quot;)
while routing the last segment. The segment will automatically be extended to
the end-pin of the trace. Alternatively, you can place the cursor over the
end-pin and left-click. Our final trace is shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/route8.gif" width="341" height="265"></p>
<p align="left">While routing a trace, you can right-click to stop routing
before the trace is completed. The unrouted portion of the connection will be
shown as a ratline between the last vertex and the end-pin. You can finish the
trace later by selecting the ratline and routing it from either end. A trace can
even have multiple unrouted portions, as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/route10.gif" width="624" height="265"></p>
<p align="left">While a segment is being dragged, the <b>Routing Grid</b> will be in effect. If the starting point for the segment is on the
routing grid, then the <b>Snap Angle</b> will also be in effect.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.136 Changing and Swapping Pins</b></font></p>
<p align="left"> You can change the end-pin
of a partially-routed trace by selecting the ratline to the pin and pressing F5
(&quot;Change Pin&quot;), then drawing a new ratline to a different pin.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"> You can
swap pins in a part by selecting one of them, holding down the &quot;s&quot; key
and clicking on the other pin. You will be prompted to swap the connections to
the pins.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b><a name="4.137 Stub Traces">5.137 Stub Traces</a></b></font></p>
<p>Besides traces based on connections between pins, FreePCB supports <b>stub</b> <b>traces</b>.
These are traces that start at a pin, but do not end at a pin. Instead, they
end blindly, usually with a via. Stub traces are mainly used to connect SMT pins to
copper areas, which will be described in <a href="user_guide_areas.htm">Section
5.14: Copper Areas</a>. To create a stub trace, select the starting pin. Press
F3 (&quot;Start Stub&quot;) to start dragging a trace segment from the pin. The
segment will be on the currently active layer, unless the pin is a SMT pin, in
which case the active layer will change to the layer of the pin. Left-click to
place a vertex. If you want more than one segment, add additional vertices. Then
terminate the stub trace by right-clicking. The trace will end at the last
vertex that you placed, and a via will be added at the vertex. If you don't want
the via, select it and press F3 (&quot;Delete Via&quot;). If the via passes
through a copper area on the same net as the starting pin, a thermal relief will
be placed to connect the via to the copper area. An example of a stub trace
connecting a pin to a copper area is shown below. The thermal relief is
represented by the &quot;X&quot; drawn on the via in the ratline color.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/stub_trace.gif" width="227" height="243"></p>
<p align="left"><b>Important Note:</b> A stub trace can be converted to a regular pin-to-pin trace by
routing it to a pad. When you place the end-point of a segment anywhere on a pad
that is connected to the same net (or not connected to any net) the stub trace
will automatically connect and terminate. This can be very useful if you are
designing a PCB &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, without a netlist.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="3"><b>5.138 Modifying Traces</b></font></p>
