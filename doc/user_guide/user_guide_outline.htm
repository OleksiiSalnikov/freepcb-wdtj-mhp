<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">5.10 Board Outline</font></p>
<p>The <b>board outline</b> represents the outline of the PCB (duh!). In
FreePCB, it consists of a <b>closed</b> <b>polyline</b> (or <b>polygon</b>)
consisting of 3 or more <b>sides</b>, with <b>corners</b> between the sides. The
sides may be straight line segments or <b>arcs</b>. An arc is one quadrant of an
ellipse whose major axis is parallel to either x or y. The advantage of using this
limited definition of an arc is that the arc is completely defined by the
position of its endpoints and a direction, which may be clockwise or
counterclockwise. A sample board outline consisting of 10 corners and 10 sides
is shown below. Note that two of the sides are arcs.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/board_outline5.gif" width="537" height="364"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The board outline is created by selecting <u><font face="System" color="#008000">Add
&gt; Boar</font></u><font face="System" color="#008000"><u>d
Outline</u></font>. There can only be one board outline in a project, so if one already exists
you will be prompted to delete it. The cursor will change into a cross-hair.
Place the starting corner by left-clicking the mouse. You will then find
yourself dragging a rubber-band representation of the first side. Left-clicking
again will place the second corner, and you will be rubber-banding the second
side. Continue until you have placed the last corner, then right-click to close
the polyline by drawing a side back to the starting corner.</p>
<p>While drawing, you can change the <b>style</b> of the current side from
straight to an arc by using the appropriate
function keys (F1 for straight, F2 for a clockwise arc and F3 for a
counterclockwise arc). The style that you select will remain in effect until you
change it. Note that arcs become straight lines if the end-points are vertical
or horizontal.</p>
<p>Placement of the corners will be controlled by the Placement Grid, which
should be set to an appropriate value before starting to draw the outline.
Placement will also be controlled by the Snap Angle. If the Snap Angle is 45
degrees, then arcs will be quadrants of a circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the outline has been created, you can edit it in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can reposition a corner by clicking on it to select it. A small white
    square will appear around the corner indicating that it has been selected,
    and the status bar will indicate which corner has been selected. Then press
    F4 (&quot;Move Corner&quot;) to start dragging the corner to a new position.
    Or press F1 (&quot;Set Position&quot;) to pop up a dialog which will let you
    set the position of the corner explicitly, as shown below:
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/corner_position.gif"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You can add a corner by clicking on a side to select it. It will turn
    white to indicate that it has been selected. Then press F4 (&quot;Add
    Corner&quot;) and you will be dragging a new corner, with rubber-band sides
    to the adjacent corners. Left-click to place it. This only works with
    straight sides, so if the side is an arc then you will have to change it to
    a straight line first (see below).</li>
  <li>You can delete a corner by selecting it and pressing F5 (&quot;Delete
    Corner&quot;). The corner will disappear, and the adjacent sides will be
    replaced by one side between the adjacent corners.</li>
  <li>You can change the style of a side by selecting it and then pressing F1
    (&quot;Straight Line&quot;), F2 (&quot;Arc CW&quot;) or F3 (&quot;Arc
    CCW&quot;).</li>
  <li>The entire outline can be deleted by selecting any side or corner and
    pressing F7 (&quot;Delete Outline&quot;).</li>
</ul>
