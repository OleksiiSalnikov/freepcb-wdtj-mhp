<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">7.6 Placing Parts</font></p>
<p>In this section, we will place the parts on our PCB.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Placement</u></font> grid to a reasonable value such as 100 mils for placing
    the through-hole parts, which have a pin spacing of 100 mils. This will make
    it easier to align the parts. Later, we may use a smaller grid for the
    surface-mount parts.</li>
  <li>Select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Show all</u></font> from
    the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>View</u></font> menu (or press
    the &quot;Home&quot; key) so that you
    can see all of the parts. It will
    help if you make the FreePCB window as large as possible (although then you
    may have trouble seeing this tutorial, unless you have dual monitors).</li>
  <li>Before placing any parts, take a minute to review the schematic. If you
    haven't already done it, it may be useful to print the schematic so that you
    can refer to it while designing the PCB. Since U1 is the largest and most
    &quot;connected&quot; part, I would suggest placing it somewhere near the
    center of the board, with the other IC's near it. The headers JP1-JP6 should
    probably be placed near the edges.</li>
  <li>Let's start by placing U1. Select it by clicking on it. A white outline
    should appear around the part, indicating that it has been selected. Be
    careful not to click on one of the pads or the reference designator, or you
    will select that instead of the entire part.&nbsp;If you are having trouble
    finding U1, you can use <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>View &gt; Show
    part</u></font> to select it by reference designator.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Tip:</b> Sometimes it can be difficult
    to select a small part that has relatively large pads, such as a
    surface-mount capacitor. However, here is a trick that you can use. FreePCB
    will never select something that is already selected, if there is an
    alternative. Therefore, if you click on a part and select a pad instead (or
    any overlapping structure), just click again and you will usually get the
    part. You have to be sure to allow enough time between clicks that Windows
    doesn't mistake your two clicks for a double-click, which usually doesn't do
    anything.</li>
  <li>With U1 selected, press F4 to begin moving it. Drag it towards the center of the board. The
    cursor will be &quot;attached&quot; to pin 1 of the part. Rotate it by
    pressing F3 once, so that it is vertical with pin 1 in the upper left
    corner. When it is near the center of the board, left-click to place it. It
    should look something like:</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/placement1.gif" width="668" height="477"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Notice that the ratlines moved with the part. After you placed it,
    you might have noticed that some of the ratlines changed their pin
    connections. This is because FreePCB automatically optimizes the ratlines
    for minimum total length after moving a part.</li>
  <li>Now let's place the other DIP ICs, U1 and Y1, something like this:</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/placement2.gif" width="666" height="475"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Now place the DIP headers around the edges of the board, something like:</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/placement3.gif" width="562" height="397"></p>

<ul>
  <li>As you place the parts, it is a good idea&nbsp; to look at the ratlines to
    try to find an optimal placement for easy routing. However, you don't
    necessarily have to see at ALL of the ratlines. On this board, we will be
    using internal power and ground planes for the VCC and GND nets. Therefore, we might as well make the ratlines for
    these nets invisible</li>
  <li>Select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Nets...</u></font> from the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Project</u></font>
    menu. The following dialog should appear:</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/netlist.gif" width="608" height="504"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Most of the dialog is occupied by a list of all of the nets.
    The number of pins and the trace and via widths for each net are shown next to
    the net name. Also, to the left of&nbsp; each name is a checkbox, which
    determines the visibility of the net ratlines. Currently, all nets are
    visible. To make the VCC and GND nets invisible, uncheck the boxes next to
    them. Then click <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>OK</u></font>. Now there are fewer ratlines visible.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/placement4.gif" width="564" height="397"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Now place the rest of the parts. As mentioned above, selecting some of the
    smaller surface-mount capacitors may be tricky, unless you place the cursor
    precisely between the pads, or use the two-click method. You may want to use
    a smaller <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Placement</u></font>  grid,
    such as 50 mils. As you place each
    part, you may have to move the other parts around to make room or to improve
    the efficiency of the connections. Try not to crowd things too much. On a
    real-life densely populated board, the parts placement may be critical to
    successful routing, so it pays to take the time to get it right. That
    shouldn't be much of a problem on this board, however.&nbsp;</li>
  <li> You can see my final
    parts placement below. Note that I moved U2 to the right of U1 to shorten
    the ratlines between these parts.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/placement5.gif" width="563" height="398"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Now, let's position the reference designators for the
    parts on the silk-screen layer, so they will be correctly oriented and visible when the parts are
    soldered on. First, set the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Placement</u></font> grid to a
    small value, such as 10
    mils, for finer control of the placement of these small items. Select each
    reference designator by clicking on it, and move it with the F4 key. As with
    parts, F3 rotates the reference designator while dragging.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Since the reference designators for the mounting holes aren't very useful,
    you can make them invisible by selecting them and pressing F5 (&quot;Set
    Size&quot;), and then setting their size to zero. Since they are positioned
    directly over the pads for the mounting holes, you probably won't be able to
    select them by clicking on them, since you will get either the part or the
    pin instead. Therefore, use the <b>selection mask</b> to disable selection
    of parts and/or pins, and then click on the reference designator.
    Alternatively, with the mounting hole part selected, select <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Set
    Ref. Text Size</u></font> from the right-click menu. This is also how you
    would make them visible again by increasing their size.</li>
  <li>Here is the
    final screenshot.</li>
