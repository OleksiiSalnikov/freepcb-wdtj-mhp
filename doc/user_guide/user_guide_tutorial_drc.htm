<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">7.11 Checking Design Rules</font></p>

<p align="left"><b>Design Rules</b> are a set of rules that establish lower
limits for dimensions such as trace widths and clearances. They are necessary
because the PCB manufacturing process is subject to certain limitations and
tolerances, and the design has to allow for this. For example, you can't use
trace widths of 1 mil in your layout, because it is physically impossible to
etch them reliably.</p>
<p align="left">If you are having your PCBs made for you, the board house should
provide design rules based on their process. For example, Advanced Circuits
recommends the following for their low-cost process:</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="450">
    <tr>
      <td width="337">Minimum trace width</td>
      <td width="109">0.008 inch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="337">Minimum clearance between copper features</td>
      <td width="109">0.008 inch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="337">Minimum distance from copper to edge of PCB</td>
      <td width="109">0.014 inch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="337">Minimum annular ring width (pins)</td>
      <td width="109">0.007 inch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="337">Minimum annular ring width (vias)</td>
      <td width="109">0.005 inch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="337">Minimum silkscreen line width</td>
      <td width="109">0.008 inch</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p align="left">The<b> Design Rule Checker</b>  (or <b>DRC</b>) is a tool that you can use to
make sure that your project doesn't contain any violations of these rules.&nbsp;
These are referred to as<b> DRC Errors</b>. Since your
tutorial project may not actually contain any DRC Errors, I would
suggest that you close your project and instead open <font face="System" color="#000000">C:\freepcb\tutorial\motor_drc_errors.fpc</font>,
as shown below. This contains several typical errors. See if you can
spot them.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout.gif" width="817" height="580"></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;Now let's run the Design Rule Checker. You can launch it by selecting
the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Tools &gt; Design Rule Check</u></font>
menu item. This will pop up the following dialog:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc.gif" width="252" height="483"></p>
<p align="left">We will modify the fields in the dialog to match the Advanced
Circuits values. <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>Trace width</u></font> should be
set to 8 mils. The <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>pad to pad</u></font>,
<font face="System" color="#008000"><u>pad to trace</u></font>, <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>trace
to trace</u></font> and <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>copper area to
copper area</u></font> values should be set to 8 mils. The <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>annular
ring (pins)</u></font> values should be set to 7 mils, and the <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>annular
ring (vias)</u></font> value should be set to 5 mils. The <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>board
edge to any copper</u></font> field should be set to 14 mils. The <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>hole
to pad or trace</u></font>, <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>board
edge to hole</u></font> and <font face="System" color="#008000"><u>hole to hole</u></font>
values are not given, so let's use 25 mils which seems reasonable. Your dialog
should look like:</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_ac.gif" width="252" height="483"></p>

<p align="left">Now click OK to run the checker. A new dialog should pop up with
a list of errors, as shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_errs.gif" width="560" height="483"></p>

<p align="left">Errors 0 and 1 are violations of the minimum clearance between
pads and the board edge. Errors 2 and 3 are trace-to-pad violations. If you look closely at the layout
window, you will see that symbols consisting of small orange rings have
been placed at the site of each error, as shown below.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout2.gif" width="648" height="438"></p>

<p align="left">These small circles may be hard to see, but
if you press the &quot;d&quot; key on the keyboard they become much larger
solid circles, as shown.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout3.gif" width="649" height="441"></p>

<p align="left">Now zoom in on one of the errors, such as the one at U1.16.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout4.gif" width="348" height="324"></p>

<p align="left">Click on the DRC Error ring to highlight it. The PCB elements
that caused the violation will also be highlighted, as shown. Also, a
description of the error will appear in the status bar.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout5.gif" width="350" height="323"></p>

<p align="left">In this case, the error is a clearance violation between pad
U1.16 and the trace segment passing through it, which are not on the same net.&nbsp;Oops!
You can fix the error by rerouting the trace to avoid the pad, as shown. Note
that the DRC Error symbol doesn't automatically disappear, but you can delete it
by selecting it and pressing the &quot;Delete&quot; key, or by re-running the
Design Rule Checker.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout6.gif" width="334" height="318">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">Now let's zoom in on the DRC Errors on the left side of the
board, and select one of them.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout7.gif" width="307" height="324"></p>

<p align="left">In this case, the error is a pad-to-board-edge violation. Basically,
JP6 is too close to the edge of the board. We can solve the problem by moving it
further to the right, as shown.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="graphics/drc_tut_layout8.gif" width="286" height="316"></p>

<p align="left">I will leave it up to you to find and fix the last error. Then
you can run the Design Rule Checker again, which should not find any errors.</p>

<p align="left">You should reload your&nbsp; <font face="System" color="#000000">motor.fpc</font>&nbsp;
project before beginning the
next section. When you close the&nbsp; <font face="System" color="#000000">motor_drc_errors.fpc</font>&nbsp;
project, I would suggest that you do NOT save your changes, so you or someone
else can use it again.</p>
